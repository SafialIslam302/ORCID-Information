   Subspace}}, Journal= {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}}, Year= {{2008}}, Volume= {{9}}, Pages= {{1647-1678}}, Month= {{AUG}}, Abstract= {{The statistical problem of estimating the effective dimension-reduction
   (EDR) subspace in the multi-index regression model with deterministic
   design and additive noise is considered. A new procedure for recovering
   the directions of the EDR subspace is proposed. Many methods for
   estimating the EDR subspace perform principal component analysis on a
   family of vectors, say (beta) over cap (1),...,(beta) over cap (L),
   nearly lying in the EDR subspace. This is in particular the case for the
   structure-adaptive approach proposed by Hristache et al. (2001a). In the
   present work, we propose to estimate the projector onto the EDR subspace
   by the solution to the optimization problem
   minimize max(l-1,...,L)(beta) over cap (T)(l)(I - A)(beta) over cap (l)
   subject to A is an element of A(m){*},
   where A(m){*} is the set of all symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in
   {[}0, 1] and trace less than or equal to m{*}, with m{*} being the true
   structural dimension. Under mild assumptions, root n-consistency of the
   proposed procedure is proved (up to a logarithmic factor) in the case
   when the structural dimension is not larger than 4. Moreover, the
   stochastic error of the estimator of the projector onto the EDR subspace
   is shown to depend on L logarithmically. This enables us to use a large
   number of vectors (beta) over cap (l) for estimating the EDR subspace.
   The empirical behavior of the algorithm is studied through numerical
   simulations.}}, ISSN= {{1532-4435}}, ResearcherID-Numbers= {{Spokoiny, Vladimir/L-5441-2015

   does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure.
   The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, and the

   manifold structure. The method is also scalable and computationally
   feasible. Our intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art
   performance of the method in various artificial examples and
   applications to text data. The idea of the method is to identify the
   clustering structure by checking at different points and for different
   scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure
   describes the clustering structure in terms of weights w(ij), and each
   of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor
   local clusters using statistical tests of ``no gap{''} between them. The
   procedure starts from very local scale, and then, the parameter of
   locality grows by some factor at each step. We also provide a rigorous
   theoretical study of the procedure and state its optimal sensitivity to

   play an important role. This is especially the case when analyzing data
   in form of two or three or even higher dimensional images. Such images
   arise in several fields, e.g. from satellite imaging, radar, x-rays,
   ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Usually these images will
   suffer from distortions. Often interesting structures correspond to
   contours, i.e. procedures used in this context should both reduce
   distortions as well as preserve discontinuities.
   We propose anew iterative procedure for image de-noising. The procedure
   is data adaptive, edge preserving and allows for a maximal amount of
   smoothing in homogeneous regions.

   studies as a compromise between too restrictive parametric models and
   flexible but hardly estimable purely nonparametric, models. By such
   modeling the statistical analysis usually focuses on estimating the
   index coefficients. The average derivative estimator (ADE) of the index
   vector is based on the fact that the average gradient of a single index
   function f(x(T)beta) is proportional to the index vector beta.
   Unfortunately, a straightforward application of this idea meets the
   so-called ``curse of dimensionality{''} problem if the dimensionality d
   of the model is larger than 2. However, prior information about the
   vector beta can be used for improving the quality of gradient estimation
   by extending the weighting kernel in a direction of small directional
   derivative. The method proposed in this paper consists of such iterative
   improvements of the original ADE. The whole procedure requires at most 2

   martingale setting, with mild conditions on the time series structure
   and virtually no assumption on filters, we show that the adaptive filter

   estimators. The quality of estimation is measured in terms of the rate
   function related to the contrast, thus allowing to derive exponential
   risk bounds invariant with respect to the detailed probabilistic
   structure of the model. This approach works well for small or moderate
   samples and covers the case of a misspecified parametric model. Another
   important feature of the presented bounds is that they may be used in
   the case when the parametric set is not compact. These bounds do not
   rely on the entropy or covering numbers and can be easily computed. The
   most important statistical fact resulting from the exponential bonds is
   a concentration inequality which claims that minimum contrast estimators
   concentrate with a large probability on the level set of the rate
   function. In typical situations, every such set is a root-n neighborhood

   help for bounding the estimation risk and constructing confidence sets

   Basel committee for regular banking supervisory. There are however
   limitations of some widely-used risk management methods that either
   calculate risk measures under the Gaussian distributional assumption or
   involve numerical difficulty. The primary aim of this paper is to
   present a realistic and fast method, GHICA, which overcomes the
   limitations in multivariate risk analysis. The idea is to first retrieve
   independent components (ICs) out of the observed high-dimensional time
   series and then individually and adaptively fit the resulting ICs in the
   generalized hyperbolic (GH) distributional framework. For the volatility
   estimation of each IC, the local exponential smoothing technique is used
   to achieve the best possible accuracy of estimation. Finally, the fast
   Fourier transformation technique is used to approximate the density of
   the portfolio returns.
   The proposed GHICA method is applicable to covariance estimation as
   well. It is compared with the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)
   method based on the simulated data with d = 50 GH distributed
   components. We further implement the GHICA method to calculate risk
   measures given 20-dimensional German DAX portfolios and a dynamic
   exchange rate portfolio. Several alternative methods are considered as

   nonstationary time series with applications to volatility modeling for
   financial data. The approach is based on the assumption of local
   homogeneity: for every time point, there exists a historical interval of
   homogeneity, in which the volatility parameter can be well approximated
   by a constant. The proposed procedure recovers this interval from the
   data using the local change point (LCP) analysis. Afterward, the
   estimate of the volatility can be simply obtained by local averaging.
   The approach carefully addresses the question of choosing the tuning
   parameters of the procedure using the so-called ``propagation{''}
   condition. The main result claims a new ``oracle{''} inequality in terms
   of the modeling bias which measures the quality of the local constant
   approximation. This result yields the optimal rate of estimation for
   smooth and piecewise constant volatility functions. Then, the new
   procedure is applied to some data sets and a comparison with a standard
   GARCH model is also provided. Finally, we discuss applications of the
   new method to the Value at Risk problem. The numerical results

The main

   the gap between parametric and nonparametric theory and to build a
   unified framework for statistical estimation. The main results include

   parametric form of the processes. On the contrary, we only suppose that
   the volatility can be approximated by a constant over some interval. In
   such a framework, the main problem consists of filtering this interval
   of time homogeneity; then the estimate of the volatility can be simply
   obtained by local averaging. We construct a locally adaptive volatility,
   estimate (LAVE) which can perform this task and investigate it both from
   the theoretical point of view and through Monte Carlo simulations.
   Finally, the LAVE procedure is applied to a data set of nine exchange
   rates and a comparison with a standard GARCH model is also provided.
   Both models appear to be capable of explaining many of the features of
   the data; nevertheless, the new approach seems to be superior to the
   GARCH method as far as the out-of-sample results are concerned.}}, ISSN= {{0090-5364}}, ResearcherID-Numbers= {{Spokoiny, Vladimir/L-5441-2015

   damage and partial movements in their upper limb joints underwent a
   3-week treatment. Nine of them were treated for additional 3-weeks after
   a 3-week break. After the first 3-week treatment, significant
   improvements were observed, in all the subjects, in the active range of
   motion (ROM) of the shoulder and the wrist joints, on manual dexterity
   tests and on functional independence measure (FIM). After the two
   periods of treatment the nine subjects exhibited significant
   improvements in ROM and in manual dexterity. FIM score increased by the
   same rate after each of the three stages. This preliminary study has
