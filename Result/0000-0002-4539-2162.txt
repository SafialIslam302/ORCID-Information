  abstract  = "This paper describes a course that has been running for over nine years, teaching Programming to large number of Mathematics students. The distinctive features of it include the fact that it was designed as part of a wholesale curriculum review (rather than being a pre-packaged course), that its design took into account the nature of the syllabus and what else the students would be using programming for, both in the rest of their course and beyond, and that the course is more than “just” a programming course.",

  title     = "Balanced model order reduction for linear random dynamical systems driven by L{\'e}vy noise",
  abstract  = "When solving linear stochastic differential equations numerically, usually a high order spatial discretisation is used. Balanced truncation (BT) and singular perturbation approximation (SPA) are well-known projection techniques in the deterministic framework which reduce the order of a control system and hence reduce computational complexity. This work considers both methods when the control is replaced by a noise term. We provide theoretical tools such as stochastic concepts for reachability and observability, which are necessary for balancing related model order reduction of linear stochastic differential equations with additive L{\'e}vy noise. Moreover, we derive error bounds for both BT and SPA and provide numerical results for a specific example which support the theory.",

  title     = "A low-rank approach to the solution of weak constraint variational data assimilation problems",
  abstract  = "Weak constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation is an important method for incorporating data (typically observations) into a model. The linearised system arising within the minimisation process can be formulated as a saddle point problem. A disadvantage of this formulation is the large storage requirements involved in the linear system. In this paper, we present a low-rank approach which exploits the structure of the saddle point system using techniques and theory from solving large scale matrix equations. Numerical experiments with the linear advection–diffusion equation, and the non-linear Lorenz-95 model demonstrate the effectiveness of a low-rank Krylov subspace solver when compared to a traditional solver.",

  title     = "GMRES convergence bounds for eigenvalue problems",
  abstract  = "The convergence of GMRES for solving linear systems can be influenced heavily by the structure of the right hand side. Within the solution of eigenvalue problems via inverse iteration or subspace iteration, the right hand side is generally related to an approximate invariant subspace of the linear system. We give detailed and new bounds on (block) GMRES that take the special behavior of the right hand side into account and explain the initial sharp decrease of the GMRES residual. The bounds give rise to adapted preconditioners applied to the eigenvalue problems, e.g. tuned and polynomial preconditioners. The numerical results show that the new (block) GMRES bounds are much sharper than conventional bounds and that preconditioned subspace iteration with either a tuned or polynomial preconditioner should be used in practice.",

  abstract = "We consider four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) and show that it can be interpreted as Tikhonov or L2-regularisation, a widely used method for solving ill-posed inverse problems. It is known from image restoration and geophysical problems that an alternative regularisation, namely L1-norm regularisation, recovers sharp edges better than L2-norm regularisation. We apply this idea to 4DVar for problems where shocks and model error are present and give two examples which show that L1-norm regularisation performs much better than the standard L2-norm regularisation in 4DVar.",

  title     = "The Impact of Multiplication Operators on the Ill-Posedness of Inverse Problems",
  abstract  = "In this work we deal with the degree of ill-posedness of linear operators in Hilbert spaces, where the operator may be decomposed into a compact linear integral operator with a well-known decay rate of singular values and a multiplication operator. This case occurs, for example, for nonlinear operator equations. Then the local degree of ill-posedness is investigated via the Frechet derivative, providing the situation described above. If the multiplier function has got zeroes, the determination of the local degree of ill-posedness is not trivial. We are going to investigate this situation, provide analytical tools as well as their limitations. By using several numerical approaches for computing the singular values we find that the degree of ill-posedness does not change through those multiplication operators. We provide a conjecture, verified by several numerical studies, how those operators influence the singular values. Finally, we analyze the influence of these multiplication operators on Tikhonov regularization and corresponding convergence rates. In this context we also provide a short summary on the relationship between nonlinear problems and their linearizations.",
